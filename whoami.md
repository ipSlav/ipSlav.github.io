subtitle: I'm just a guy obsessed with understanding how things actually work

My name is Petar Jr. Pranic and I am a red team guy who's trying to move into purple team.
I love understading how things work internally, trying to make a sense on what is happening under the hood of our digital world.
My primary interest lies in researching and detecting attacker techniques and malware with a focus on Windows OS, Active Directory and EntraID.
