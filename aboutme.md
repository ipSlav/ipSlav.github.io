<p style="margin-bottom: 8rem;">
My name is Petar Jr. Pranic and I am a red team guy passionate about adversary tradecraft analysis and detection.<br><br>
Throughout my experience in the offensive security field, I have participated in and managed several engagements targeting mid to large enterprises spanning several industries.
  
I love understading how things work internally, trying to make a sense on what is happening under the hood of our digital world.<br>
My primary interest lies in researching and detecting attacker techniques with a focus on Microsoft products.
