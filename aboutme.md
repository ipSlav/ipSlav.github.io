<p style="margin-bottom: 8rem;">
My name is Petar Jr. Pranic and I am a red team guy interested in purple team and detection engineering.
I love understading how things work internally, trying to make a sense on what is happening under the hood of our digital world.
My primary interest lies in researching and detecting attacker techniques with a focus on Microsoft products and services.
