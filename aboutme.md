title: About me
subtitle: I'm just a guy obsessed with understanding how things work
---

My name is Petar Jr. Pranic and I am a red team guy currently working as a Red Team Manager in [Shielder](https://www.shielder.com) leading a small team dedicated to Offensive Operations activities.
Throughout my experience in the offensive security field, I have participated in and managed more than 100 engagements targeting mid and large enterprises spanning several industries.<br>

Outside my day to day job responsibilities, my primary interest lies in analyzing and detecting adversary tradecrafts and techniques, with a focus on Microsoft products, trying to understand how things work internally and make a sense on what is happening under the hood of our digital world.
